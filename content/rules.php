	<h2>Taking the lead</h2>
	<p class="warn" style="margin: 5px 0px 10px 0px;">
		Pleas read carefully!
	</p>
	<p class="first-line">
		Every task you solve is worth 1 point.
		Be aware that you will first be ranked by the number of tasks solved, than, in case of a tie, the tiebreaker will be time it took to solve those tasks.
		So you must solve tasks and keep track of time. NOTE!!!: once you open a task the clock starts. Be careful.
		Should you get stuck, you may request hints through Skype chat at securiteam_support.
		For reporting errors, and being nice in general, you may be rewarded extra points, of course this works the other way around too.
